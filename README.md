👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Samuel — a Master’s student in Data Science with a background in psychology and business administration.  
My main focus is **data analytics and data analysis**: understanding data, extracting meaning, and translating insights into decisions that actually matter.

Alongside analytics, I bring strong foundations in **data science and machine learning**, with a growing interest in **human-centered AI** — especially where data, behavior, and technology intersect.

I’m drawn to work that blends technical craft with humility, curiosity, and a desire to build with purpose.

📊 What I’m Working On (Analytics First)

• **Forkast – Smart Meal Planner (Data + Analytics System)**  
A data-driven system built with React, Flask, MongoDB, and Docker.  
My work centered on data ingestion, API testing, database inspection, and interpreting user input data to support real-world decision-making.

• **Stock Market Data Analysis Project**  
An applied analysis project exploring stock/financial data through time-series exploration, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.  
The focus is on trends, interpretation, and what the data reveals about market behavior.

• **Data Analytics Course Project**  
An end-to-end analytics workflow: cleaning, transformation, exploratory analysis, visualization, and communicating insights in a business-relevant way.

🤖 Supporting Projects (Data Science + Human-Centered AI)

• **Facial Emotion Recognition (CNN-Based)**  
Built from scratch to classify facial expressions, with attention to real-world applications and ethical considerations.

• **Auralis – Music Recommendation System (In Progress)**  
A personal project exploring recommendation through listening behavior, patterns, and user intent — blending analytics, ML, and creativity.

• **Multi-Modal Emotion AI (Thesis – Ongoing)**  
Extending facial emotion recognition into speech and text-based emotion modeling using RNN/LSTM and transformer approaches.

🧠 Systems, Foundations, & Research

• Deploying **MongoDB distributed databases** across multiple VMs (validation rules, stored procedures, aggregation pipelines, explain plans)  
• Building a **local RAG chatbot** using FAISS, LoRA, Flan-T5, and Gradio  
• Practicing algorithms & data structures (recursion, trees, graphs, hash tables) using Python  
• Researching **hybrid intelligence in healthcare AI** (human–AI collaboration and decision support)

🎯 What I’m Looking For

I’m seeking opportunities in **data analytics / data-focused roles** where I can:
• Work with real-world data to generate meaningful insights  
• Learn from mentors and collaborate on a strong team  
• Grow professionally while staying grounded in my values

🎶 Outside of Tech

I’m also a musician and storyteller. Whether I’m working with data or writing music, I care about intention, creativity, and meaning.  
For me, analysis and art aren’t opposites — they’re different ways of understanding the human experience.
