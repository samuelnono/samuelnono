## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi there! Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in Data Science with a background in psychology and business. Iâ€™m passionate about machine learning, human-computer collaboration, and building solutions that put people first.

I believe the best innovations happen when technical excellence is paired with humility, curiosity, and a desire to serve something bigger than ourselves.

### ðŸ’¡ What Iâ€™m Working On
- A **Local RAG Chatbot** using LoRA, Gradio, and Flan-T5 for contextual, document-based responses
-  A **facial, speech, and text emotion recognition system** using CNNs, RNNs, and transformer models for my Thesis.  
- Designing and deploying **MongoDB-based distributed databases** across VMs with custom validation rules, stored procedures, and performance explain plans  
- Practicing  **algorithmic concepts** such as recursion, trees, graphs, and hash tables using Python
- Research on hybrid intelligence in healthcare AI.

### ðŸŽ¯ What Iâ€™m Looking For
Iâ€™m actively seeking an internship where I can:
- Contribute to meaningful work in AI, data, or tech-for-good
- Learn from mentors and collaborate on impactful projects
- Grow professionally while staying rooted in my values

### ðŸŽ¶ Outside of Tech
Iâ€™m also a musician, storyteller, and passionate about creating with intention. Whether it's writing code or writing lyrics, I aim to reflect purpose, care, and creativity in everything I do.
