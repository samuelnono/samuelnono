👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Samuel — a Master’s student in Data Science with a background in psychology and business administration.  
My primary focus is **data analytics and data analysis**: understanding data, extracting meaning, and translating insights into decisions that actually matter.

Alongside analytics, I bring strong foundations in **data science and machine learning**, with a growing interest in **human-centered AI** — especially where data, behavior, and technology intersect.

I’m motivated by work that balances technical rigor with reflection, curiosity, and a genuine concern for the people behind the data.

💡 What I’m Working On

📊 Data Analytics & Analysis (Primary Focus)

• **Forkast – Smart Meal Planner**  
A data-driven analytics system built with React, Flask, MongoDB, and Docker.  
My work focused on data ingestion, API testing, database inspection, and interpreting user input data to support decision-making in real-world contexts.

• **Stock Market Data Analysis Project**  
An applied data analysis project exploring financial and stock market data through time-series analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.  
The emphasis is on identifying trends, interpreting results, and understanding what the data reveals about market behavior.

• **Data Analytics Course Project**  
An end-to-end analytics workflow involving data cleaning, transformation, exploratory analysis, visualization, and communicating insights in a business-relevant way.

🤖 Data Science & Machine Learning (Strong Support)

• **Facial Emotion Recognition (CNN-Based)**  
A machine learning project built from scratch using convolutional neural networks to classify facial expressions.  
This work connects model performance with ethical considerations and real-world applications, and serves as a foundation for my broader thesis work.

• **Auralis – Music Recommendation System (In Progress)**  
A personal project exploring music recommendation through data patterns, listening behavior, and user intent.  
Auralis blends analytics, machine learning, and creativity, and reflects my interest in emotionally aware and meaningful data-driven systems.

• **Multi-Modal Emotion AI (APP – Ongoing)**  
An extension of my facial emotion work into speech and text-based emotion recognition using RNNs, LSTMs, and transformer models.

🧠 Systems, Foundations, & Research

• Designing and deploying **MongoDB-based distributed databases** across multiple virtual machines, including validation rules, stored procedures, aggregation pipelines, and performance explain plans  
• Building a **local RAG chatbot** using FAISS, LoRA, Flan-T5, and Gradio  
• Practicing core computer science concepts such as recursion, trees, graphs, and hash tables using Python  
• Researching **hybrid intelligence in healthcare AI**, with a focus on how humans and intelligent systems collaborate

🎯 What I’m Looking For

I’m seeking opportunities in **data analytics or data-focused roles** where I can:

• Work with real-world data to generate meaningful insights  
• Grow alongside mentors and collaborative teams  
• Apply technical skills while staying grounded in strong human and ethical values

🎶 Outside of Tech

I’m also a musician and storyteller. Whether I’m working with data or writing music, I care deeply about intention, creativity, and meaning.  
For me, analysis and art aren’t opposites — they’re different ways of understanding the human experience.
