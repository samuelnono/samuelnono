👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Samuel — a Master’s student in Data Science with a background in psychology and business administration.

I design data systems that move from raw input to structured insight. My work spans ETL pipelines, distributed databases, analytics engineering, and emotion-aware AI systems — especially where data, behavior, and technology intersect.

I’m drawn to building systems with purpose: combining technical architecture with human-centered design.

🔧 Data Systems & Engineering Projects

Sakila Data Warehouse (ETL + OLAP Modeling)
Migrated a normalized MySQL OLTP schema into a snowflake-style data warehouse. Built fact tables, simulated batch loads, and developed KPI dashboards.

Celsius – Distributed MongoDB Cloud System
Designed and deployed a multi-region MongoDB architecture across VMs. Implemented validation rules, stored procedures, aggregation pipelines, and financial modeling logic.

Forkast – Dockerized Data Pipeline Application
Built a containerized full-stack system (React, Flask, MongoDB) focused on structured data ingestion, validation, and analytics-ready storage.

🤖 Applied AI & Machine Learning

Auralis – Emotion-Aware Music Recommendation System
Feature extraction + emotion mapping pipeline for personalized music recommendation.

Facial Emotion Recognition (CNN-Based)
Built from scratch for real-world emotion classification with attention to deployment constraints.

Local RAG Chatbot
Built retrieval-augmented generation pipeline using FAISS, LoRA, Flan-T5, and Gradio.

🧠 Systems, Foundations, & Research

• Deploying **MongoDB distributed databases** across multiple VMs (validation rules, stored procedures, aggregation pipelines, explain plans)  
• Building a **local RAG chatbot** using FAISS, LoRA, Flan-T5, and Gradio  
• Practicing algorithms & data structures (recursion, trees, graphs, hash tables) using Python  
• Researching **hybrid intelligence in healthcare AI** (human–AI collaboration and decision support)

🎯 What I’m Looking For

I’m seeking opportunities in **data analytics / data-focused roles** where I can:
• Work with real-world data to generate meaningful insights  
• Learn from mentors and collaborate on a strong team  
• Grow professionally while staying grounded in my values

🎶 Outside of Tech

I’m also a musician, huge sports enthusiast and storyteller. Whether I’m working with data, playing Soccer or writing music, I care about intention, creativity, and meaning.  
For me, analysis, hobbies and art are alligned — they’re different ways of understanding the human experience.
